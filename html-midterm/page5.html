    <h1>Changelog</h1> 
    
    <br>

    <h2>Page 1 Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A table element was missing its closing tag. Added the closing table tag to the table.</li>
        <li>There was no language set in the html start tag. Added a lang attribute to the html start tag: "lang="en".</li>
        <li>The relative link to the image was not correct. I added/../html-midterm/img to correctly link the picture</li>
        <li>On line 24 the "item3" was missing its closing li tag. I added that tag in.</li>
        <li>Missing a meta section in the head. Added in meta charset="UTF-8".</li>

    </ul>   

    <br>

    <h2>Page 2 Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There was no closing tag for bolding a section of text. Fixed the closing tag for bolding the words "New Beehive Inn."</li>
        <li>Impropper header order was present on lines 37 and 53. I switched the h3 and h2 so they would be in the proper order.</li>
        <li>Bold tags were placed outside the header tags. Moved bold tags elements inside the h3 tags.</li>
        <li>The name for an href link had spaces in it which aren't allowed. Replaced spaces with underscores in the "where do i go" href element. Link does not go anywhere and I can't find any materials for the link in 
            the provided files, so I assume this is the fix.</li>
        <li>Impropper header use, an h6 tag was used when an h3 tag should have been to maintain conssistency. Changed the h6 header to an h3.</li>
        <li>An h6 element was missing its closing tag, causing a bunch of issues. Added the closing tag to the h6 element that was missing.</li>
        <li>Commas in the final paragraph didin't follow the correct character set. Replaced the commas that were used in th last paragraph with correct ones.</li>
        
    </ul>
