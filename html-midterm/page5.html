    <h1>Changelog</h1> 
    
    <br>

    <h2>Page 1 Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>A table elements was missing its closing tag. Added the closing </table> tag to the table on page 1</p>
        <p>There was no language set in the html start tag. Added a lang attribute to the html start tag "lang="en"</p>
    </ul>   

    <br>

    <h2>Page 2 Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>There was no closing tag for bolding a section of text. Fixed the closing tag for bolding the words "New Beehive Inn" (</b>)</p>
        <p>Bold tage were placed outside the header tags. Moved <b> and </b> elements inside the <h2> tags</p>
        <p>The name for an href link had spaces in it which aren't allowed. Replaced spaces with underscores from "where do i go" href element. Link does not go anywhere and I can't find any materials for the link in 
            the provided files, so I assume this is the fix</p>
        <p>A h6 element was missing its closing tag, causing a bunch of issues. Added the ending tag to the <h6> element that was missing</p>
    </ul>
