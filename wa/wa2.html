        <h1>Hello there,</h1>

        <h2>My name is Luka.</h2>

        <p>I use <strong> He/Him </strong> pronouns. 
            My goal in this course is to learn a little more about coding and how it could relate to my future career path. 
            I believe HTML will be especially helpful for me in my near future.
            I am currently a senior at CU, majoring in Marketing with a minor in CTD. 
            I love <em>cars,</em> <em>the outdoors,</em> and <em>traveling</em>. 
            Most recently I spent <u>5 MONTHS</u> in Europe studying abroad last semester in <strong>Madrid</strong>
            and then spent 2 months in the summer interning for a stratup company in <em>Amsterdam</em></p>
